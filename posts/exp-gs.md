Contracted through Infosys, LLC, and based in Salt Lake City, UT, I joined the FIX Integration team to seamlessly integrate new FIX Protocol trading lines onto Goldman's trading platform. During my 2+ years in the position, I acquired extensive knowledge in scripting, FIX, and large corporate software stacks.

Notable achievements include:

 - Devised and implemented automated trading lines using C++ and Minislang, enhancing efficiency and profitability for Goldman Sachs clients.
 - Resolved intricate FIX message protocol issues, ensuring seamless communication between Goldman Sachs and clients.
 - Contributed to the development of an online catalog of learning resources for the FIX Client Onboarding department, optimizing the training process for new personnel.

In May 2023, I voluntarily stepped down from my position as I desired to relocate from Salt Lake City, UT.
