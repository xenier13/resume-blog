Contracted through Adecco, based in Phoenix, AZ, I was a troubleshooter for various AV-related technical and behavioral issues.

Achievements include:

 - Initiated the development of innovative archiving and data structuring tools, enhancing issue and task categorization.
 - Formulated novel mitigation strategies for failure modes, actively contributing to ongoing mitigation plans.
 - Collaborated with team members to identify potential points of failure and devised corresponding failure modes.

"Mason consistently demonstrated exceptional dedication, expertise, and a proactive problem-solving approach. One remarkable aspect of his contribution was his initiative in learning new skills and tools autonomouslyâ€”without specific guidance, he willingly jumped into new endeavors. Mason's proactive attitude extended to his daily work, making him the best performer consistently. Furthermore, his ability to think outside the box was particularly noteworthy when tackling novel issues. A collaborative team player, Mason not only surpassed targets with a results-driven mindset but also contributed significantly to our continuous improvement."
