While at Fidelity Investments, I played a role in closing orphaned and decommissioned accounts as part of National Financial Services Middle Office.

Key Achievements:

 - Spearheaded a team project, saving approximately $60,000 annually through streamlined processes.
 - Successfully resolved a variety of issues related to complex securities and products, ensuring accurate and timely trade processing.
 - Continuously integrated new knowledge and skills into existing policies, enhancing operational efficiency and quality.

In early 2021, during the peak of the COVID pandemic, I made the decision to step down to explore new career opportunities.

"Mason was a very solid employee for me. He showed great ability to work across different parts of the organization and was very knowledgeable. This was quite evident to me when I had Mason take the lead on a project. It required Mason to work outside of his comfort zone. He was able to produce some great results. It also showed me that Mason had the capability to multitask and still maintain the quality of work that we have come to expect from him. Also, communication played an important part in the success of this project. Overall Mason very an excellent worker and strong team player."

-Anthony Chiusano, Senior Director, Middle Office Outsourcing
